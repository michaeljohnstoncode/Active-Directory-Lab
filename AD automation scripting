Active Directory automation w/ Powershell

We could make each user a "member of" a group manually, but problems will arise if you have hundreds, or thousands of users that you need to make changes to.
How to solve this problem? Automation through scripting!

$ = declare a variable
| (pipe symbol) = take output of $users, and pipe it into another command

# Get attributes of a specific user
$findUser = Get-ADUser -Identity [userName]  
# add "-Properties *" to find all attributes of user, or "-Properties [property]" for specific property

# Get all AD users and print out to grid view
import-module ActiveDirectory
$users = Get-ADUser -Filter
Write-Host ($users | Out-GridView)
